# Beginner Friendly C++ Programming 

This repository contains beginner friendly, easy to understand handwritten C++11 notes. Here you will learn the real C++ that is used in Real Production Systems.

##  Why my notes ?

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Easy to understand handwritten notes.
> - Prepared from real authentic sources.
> - Include modern programming practises.
> - With properly updated real coding test, designed to test your knowledge.

## How to test your knowledge ?

To test your knowledge, you should not use any kind of AI for solution. 
In this AI era, our minds got shrunk by large number, like for every task these days, we use AI.
But for these test you should not use AI. 

Here is the detailed approach for going through problem list.

1. See this [Problems List](/code_exam/problems.md)
2. Skip those questions, that you have already solved or the underlying concept is clear to you.
3. Pick a question that you want is suitable for you.
4. Try solving 3 to 4 times on your own, if you still got it wrong consistently after 4 tries, then you are allowed to use AI.
