# Chapter 6 — Loops

1. Sum 1..N.
   - Task: Read N and print sum 1 to N.
   - Input: N
   - Output: integer sum

2. Print even numbers.
   - Task: Read N and print even numbers from 0 to N inclusive on one line separated by spaces.
   - Input: N
   - Output: numbers or empty line if none

3. While loop pattern.
   - Task: Read N and print N lines with the line number repeated (i.e., line i prints i i i).
   - Input: N

4. Nested loops.
   - Task: Print multiplication table for numbers 1..N (N up to 10).
   - Input: N
   - Output: N lines each contain N products separated by spaces.


# Chapter 7 — Jump statements

1. Break example.
   - Task: Read N and print numbers 0..N-1 but stop when you encounter a multiple of 7 (print that number too).
   - Input: N

2. Continue example.
   - Task: Read N and print odd numbers from 1 to N using continue.
   - Input: N

3. Goto caution example.
   - Task: Implement a search loop that uses no goto (explain in comment) — (write program that finds first negative in N numbers and prints its index or -1).
   - Input: N then N integers
   - Output: index or -1


# Chapter 8 — sizeof and types

1. Sizeof basics.
   - Task: Print sizes of char, int, long, float, double as integers in bytes, each on new line.
   - Input: none

2. Array size calculation.
   - Task: Define an array of 8 ints and print number of elements using sizeof expression.
   - Input: none

3. Pointer vs array.
   - Task: Print sizeof(pointer) and sizeof(array) for int[5] and explain difference in comments.
   - Input: none

4. Type conversion.
   - Task: Read two integers and perform floating-point division and integer division, print both results.
   - Input: a b
   - Output: two lines (float and int or ERROR if b==0)
