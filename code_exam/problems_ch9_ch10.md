# Chapter 9 — Functions

1. Simple add function.
   - Task: Write a function add(a, b) and call it to print the sum of two ints read from input.
   - Input: a b
   - Output: sum

2. Function with default parameter.
   - Task: Write multiply(a, b=2). Read one or two ints: if one given, use default second argument.
   - Input: one or two ints on a line
   - Output: product

3. Max of three.
   - Task: Write a function that returns the max of three ints. Read three ints and print the max.
   - Input: a b c
   - Output: max

4. Recursion introductory.
   - Task: Implement recursive Fibonacci (naive) and print fib(N) for small N (N ≤ 30).
   - Input: N
   - Output: fib(N)


# Chapter 10 — Call by value / reference and recursion

1. Call by value demonstration.
   - Task: Write a function that takes an int by value, adds 5, and prints the value inside the function. In main print the original before and after to show it is unchanged.
   - Input: none
   - Output: shows inside and outside values

2. Call by reference demonstration.
   - Task: Write a function that takes int& and adds 5; show original changed after the call.
   - Input: none
   - Output: shows inside and outside values

3. Sum using recursion.
   - Task: Implement recursive sum 1..N and print the result (N ≤ 1000).
   - Input: N
   - Output: integer sum

4. Factorial recursion.
   - Task: Implement recursive factorial for N up to 20 and print result as long long. Handle N=0 correctly.
   - Input: N
   - Output: factorial(N) as long long
